// Why use Vite?
//vite starts you app instantly during development, and it builds your app in a fraction of the time compared to other bundlers.
// It allows hot reload (refresh as you change code) 
// bundles app efficiently for production
// it allows you to use jsx : 


//Without Vite, you could still run a React app, 
// but youâ€™d need a lot more manual setup with tools like Webpack or Babel. Vite just makes it modern, fast, and convenient.
